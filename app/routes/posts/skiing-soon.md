This weekend is my friend Dave's stag and we've got chalets booked in Banff for
a weekend of skiing and relaxing. I'm so excited to get back out on the slopes.
I'm planning on trying to ski on all of my "good" weekends, so every other
weekend. Hopefully 15 days this year!

I've got a bit of a sore throat right now. I went to the doctor this morning and
he did a throat swab and prescribed me some penicillin. We don't know if it's
strep throat or just chemo pains, but he said it's better to overmedicate in my
case. It could be pretty bad if I get sick as I don't have the greatest immune
system now.

Other than that I'm feeling good and excited for the weekend!
