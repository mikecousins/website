Just got back from getting my stitches out of my neck. I asked for the results
from the biopsy and it's nodular sclerosing Hodgkins lymphoma. I was pretty sure
I had Hodgkins all along, but I'm still feeling kind of crappy. I guess I still
kept a little bit of hope that it might not be cancer. Oh well, I'm glad chemo
is starting next week so that I can get this going.
