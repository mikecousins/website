I recently had my last check up at the Tom Baker Cancer Center.  It marked my
5th year post-treatment.  The results were perfect and I can now relax.  I am
done with this disease and I hope to never face it again.

I sometimes thought that this day would never come.  Now that it has, it feels
surreal.  I look back and remember a lot of extremes but they seem dulled by
time.  I want to move on and have an amazing life from here on out, but
sometimes it feels wrong to ignore what has happened.

I have many ideas for what to do next and I'm excited for that.
