Wow. I had no idea this was going to happen at all. I was hanging out with my
old high school friends, driving all over the city and we were going to end up
at the Bull & Finch, one of our old watering holes. When I walked in there was
my family, co-workers, friends from school and friends from rowing. Lots of
people I hadn't seen in a long time. It was just incredible.

My girlfriend and one of my friends did most of the organizing and it was a
great job done by all. There was an auction at the pub and people donated
personally and got others to donate as well. In total they raised over $2500!
Amazing! Thank you to everybody who took part, and sorry that I couldn't see you
to all those who couldn't make it. I was really touched by the whole event.
