I went skiing on the weekend at Fernie for opening day. Pretty good time, but I
got tired out pretty quick. I had to stop skiing and head to the lodge at 3pm
(skiing closes at 4pm). I tried to salvage my consciousness with a coffee and a
Snickers, but I was passed out at a cafeteria table 2 minutes later. It was
still a great time though.

I'm about to head in for my 7th treatment, my last one of the year! I just want
this one to be over so I can enjoy Christmas/New Years. I have lots of friends
coming home and I can't wait to see them all!
