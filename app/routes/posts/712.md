Number 7 is done and it's going pretty well. I think I'm just excited because I
get 3 weeks off after this one and I'm done for the year! I'm pretty busy for
the next 3 weeks or so as friends start coming back to Calgary and Christmas
parties abound. I'm excited for Dave and Laura's wedding as well!

My Dad took my picture yesterday at chemo:
