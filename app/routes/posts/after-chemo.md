I'm feeling pretty much back to normal now. After the first chemo I was nauseous
for about 4 days. I felt like I was about to throw up all the time and
especially if I tried to eat. I lost about 8 pounds during those 4 days. About
Monday my stomach began to return to normal and I have put 4 pounds back on
since then. I've had a headache pretty much constantly since chemo. It's not too
bad but it's a constant annoyance. My chest/lungs started hurting on about
Saturday and still hurt now when I take a deep breath.

I read up about Bleomycin and it's effects on your lungs. It causes lung damage
and will cause oxygen toxicity problems which means that I can never scuba dive
again as well as never being able to be put on oxygen in the hospital. This was
quite the kick in the nards to me because I just got certified about 2 years ago
and was really enjoying it. I was planning on diving in Hawaii in April. I try
to keep my spirits up by saying that cancer is just a temporary thing and after
6 months I'll be back to normal, but stuff like this drags me back down again. I
realize that I'll never be the same again and it's a scary thought.
