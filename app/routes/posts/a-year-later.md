I'm still clean! Sorry this is a bit late, I've been a bit busy with everything.
I took on a couple contracts outside of Nortel to make some extra money and have
simply run out of hours in the day.

I now switch to checkups every 4 months instead of 3. My next one is just a
chest x-ray and bloodwork in June. I'm pretty excited because the chances of
relapse fall quite a bit after the first year has passed. Hopefully it will stay
away for a long time!
