As much as I didn't want this to affect my life, it has started to really affect
it. I already cancelled on my volleyball team for the Nortel Summer Games and
now my family and I just decided to cancel our Hawaii trip. It would end up
delaying my treatment by about a month and none of us really felt comfortable
doing that. I guess I'll have extra vacation for next year now....
