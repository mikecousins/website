Well, I've been delaying making this post because I really don't know what to
say. I got my results last Tuesday (August 22nd) and my PET scan shows 2 nodes
with metabolic activity in it. So basically there are two options here:

 1. It's just an infection/cold/whatever which is causing these 2 lymph nodes to
    do something.
    
    
 2. The cancer is back.
    
    

I have to go back in 3 months and have another PET scan. If that scan comes back
negative, then it's back to life as usual. I did have a cold the week or two
before my scan, so maybe that caused the activity. If that one is positive again
then we've got a pretty serious issue. A relapse in your first year (I'm only at
6 months) post chemo is pretty much a death sentence. Google it if you want to
see some papers on it, but it's not good.

So, I'm kind of freaking out sometimes and then thinking it might be something
else the other times. I'm always thinking about it though. This is going to be a
long three months....
