I had a great time last night! Most of my Calgary friends showed up at the Bull
& Finch and we had some food and drinks. I wanted to have a little get together
before chemotherapy started and I think it was a success! Sometimes it amazes me
how many great friends I have, I consider myself incredibly lucky to have so
much support. Thank you to everybody!
