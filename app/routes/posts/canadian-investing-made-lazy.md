**It's Easy**

One of the most common complaints that I hear about investing is that it's too
complicated and that people don't have time to learn about how to do it. The
good thing is, it pays to be lazy in investing!

[Canadian Capitalist - Lazy Man's Portfolio](http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/the-lazy-mans-portfolio/)

Almost every stock or mutual fund will lose to it's respective index. The
concept of the "lazy" portfolio is just to buy something as similar to the index
as possible. This way you will go up and down with the market and over long
periods of time you should go up. Choosing individual stocks, researching
companies, etc., usually ends up in your playing "the loser's game". Never trade
or sell your stocks, only add to the portfolio to keep your percentages as close
to the desired percentage as possible.

**Mutual Funds vs ETFs**

ETFs have become very popular lately and for good reason, they will always
perform better than their respective mutual fund because they have less
management fees. Because we're going with index funds the only differentiator
left is the amount of management fees (denoted MER, management expense ratio)
that they charge. ETFs are usually much lower, usually in the 0.1-0.3% range
rather than 0.5-3% range. They're usually an order of magnitude better. This
will mean several tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars difference by the
time you retire.

**Choosing Your Portfolio**

There are a bunch of good model portfolios floating around the web. Here are two
of my favourites:

[Efficient Market](http://www.efficientmarket.ca/article/Global_ETF_2)

I took their recommendations and customized it a bit and here's what I've
decided to go with for mine:

 * XIC - 25% - Canadian Equity - 0.05% MER
 * VTI - 20% - US Equity - 0.07% MER
 * VEA - 20% - Europe/Asia Equity - 0.12% MER
 * VWO - 5% - Emerging Equity - 0.22% MER
 * XBB - 25% - Canadian Bonds - 0.30% MER
 * RBF2010 - 5% - Canadian Cash

That's a blended MER of 0.14%! Compare that to your average mutual fund based
index portfolio which would have a blended MER closer to 1%.

RBF2010 is a mutual fund which is basically a high interest savings account
under the covers. Great for holding in an RRSP/TFSA. It currently pays out at
1.25%. I also hold XBB instead of XSB/XRB for simplicity.

**Getting Started**

To do this yourself you'll want to get a self-directed investment account from
your bank of choice:

[Royal Bank Direct Investing](http://www.rbcdirectinvesting.com/)

[TD Waterhouse Discount Brokerage](http://www.tdwaterhouse.ca/products-services/investing/discount-brokerage/index.jsp)

[CIBC Investor's Edge](https://www.investorsedge.cibc.com/ie/index.html)

etc.

There is also [Credential Direct](http://www.credentialdirect.com/) which is an independent Canadian brokerage.


Setup an RRSP and TFSA with whichever one you want and get lazy!
