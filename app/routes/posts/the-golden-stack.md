I'll keep posting this every once in a while, but this is my current preferred
stack.

**Cloud**

Azure. PaaS > IaaS.

**Database**

SQL Azure.

**API**

C# WebAPI on .NET Core.

**Web**

React. Tons of momentum behind it.

**iOS**

Swift. Don't fight Apple.

**Android**

Kotlin. Seems pretty fun.

**Simple Mobile**

React Native. For simpler projects it's nice to share some code with your web app, and the mental leap is small.
