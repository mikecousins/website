Well, I've now finished two-thirds of my chemo and this morning I had my second
PET scan. They try to get rid of all of the cancer by the two-thirds point so
this mornings test will tell us if it has worked. I'm pretty nervous about it,
have been for a couple weeks now. If there is still cancer remaining I think
that's a pretty bad sign. I don't think I'll get the results until my normal
appointment next Tuesday though. It's going to be a long wait!
