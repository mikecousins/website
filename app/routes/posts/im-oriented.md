Just got back from a great session at Tom Baker. My parents, Dawn and Jon all
came with me which was really nice. There was about an hour long presentation,
mostly on chemo side effects and how to manage them. I think it really helped
and calmed us down a bit. It doesn't sound all that bad now. We got a tour of
the hospital and got to see the chemo rooms. I got a nice folder of information
about the specific chemo drugs I'll be on. I'm feeling a little more comfortable
now. I just wish it was Thursday already and my surgery, bone marrow test and
PET scan were done!
