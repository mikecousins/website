I posted the details of my [investment strategy](http://www.mikecousins.com/canadian-investing-made-lazy/)  a while ago. I
thought I'd give an update on how it's been doing since then.

**Calendar**

  - 2010 - 4.92%
  - 2011 - -3.32%
  - 2012 - 7.87%
  - 2013 - 14.37%
  - 2014 - 10.30%
  - 2015 - 4.04%
  - 2016 - ???

**Annualized**

  - 1 year - 4.33%
  - 3 year - 6.45%
  - 5 year - 8.01%
  - 7 year - 5.91%
  - Since inception - 5.67%

**Cumulative**

  - 2010 - 4.92%
  - 2011 - 1.44%
  - 2012 - 9.42%
  - 2013 - 25.15%
  - 2014 - 38.03%
  - 2015 - 43.60%

As you can see it rode the pretty crazy last few years as well as could be
hoped.
