Dawn shaved my head today. I don't know what to think of it yet. I guess it's
not as horrible as I was imagining.

To the Victoria folk, I just got the a-ok from Howie and booked my flight out
for Head of the Gorge today. Dawn and I will be coming out on the Thursday
afternoon and flying back Sunday night. I can't wait to see you guys!
