So a little bit ago my second Windows Phone app was approved.

Here are my two apps up on the Windows Phone Marketplace:

Once the approval came through I filled out the form on the Mango App Challenge
page.

I didn't hear anything back for a while, so I contacted Paul Laberge (@plaberge)
on Twitter.  He got back to me immediately and before long I was declared a
winner!  The phones that they were offering were a bit disappointing, so I have
asked to be put on a waiting list for a newer model.  I would like to play with
a Windows Phone and I'm kind of a gadget snob.  I like fresh phones, I cannot
lie.

Kudos to Microsoft for running a great promotion.  I'm happy that I did it, it
gave me the kick in the pants that I needed to get started writing some mobile
apps.  Hopefully I'll keep up the pace and get Android and  iOS apps for Shuttr
[http://shuttr.com] released as well.
