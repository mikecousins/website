I have no idea why the last one showed activity but my +9 month scan was
completely clean. No cancer!!! I must have been excited or something for that
last one :) I have decided that these scares are going to be no fun in the
future so I hope to have few of them.

I think it's time to start enjoying life again, I was starting to get a bit down
there. Bring on the ski season!
