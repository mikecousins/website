I've had 10 out of 12 treatments now with the 2nd last one this Wednesday. I'm
getting pretty confident now and am just looking forward to being done. I
haven't updated my blog for a bit, and have had a couple requests to do so, just
because I've been feeling about average. This was my first time having 5 needles
of Neupogen, I usually have 4, so I had some amazing bone pain and didn't really
sleep at all on Friday night. I'm feeling pretty good now though and ready to do
#11.
