I just got back from my appointment at the hospital.

- My white blood cell counts are up to a decent level so I won't need to
  increase the number of Neupogen shots any more. They will remain at 4 per
  treatment (days 5, 6, 7, 8).
- My lung test shows that I have 130% of normal capacity, well above average,
  but I told him that I'm feeling quite a bit better without the Bleo in the
  last treatment. Even though I still have good lungs, I know that they were
  much better before chemo. He's decided to withold the Bleo for the rest so I
  think my lungs might be fine and scuba diving might happen again!
- My liver is clean! This means that it was a cancerous tumor and that the
  chemo has killed it all off. This is great news because it means the chemo is
  working and that I didn't have any other liver issues!

4th chemo is going to happen tomorrow and I'm happy now that I know that
everything is going well. One third done after this one!
