I hope everybody had a great Christmas! Ours was really nice and I'm feeling
great. That's important because there has been lots of turkey to eat around
here. I think my weight is almost back to normal due to excessive turkey
consumption. Enjoy your New Years and be safe over the rest of the holidays!
