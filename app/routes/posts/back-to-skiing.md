I had a great day at Sunshine Village today. Dave and I headed out and were
greeted with free passes and some of the best snow I've skiied in a couple
years. Lighting was a little flat and at about 2pm I broke my pole in half, but
it was still a great day.

I am feeling much better now after this chemo. It really took it out of me and I
didn't even get much work done until Thursday. I think I might start taking a
day or two more off of work. Right now I have chemo on Wednesday and then take
Thursday and Friday off. I think it's getting quite a bit worse though and that
I should take Monday and maybe Tuesday off as well. I didn't even go into work
on Tuesday because I felt so crappy this week.
