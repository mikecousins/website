Chemo is a good way to kill your high. I'm feeling pretty crappy again, but I'm
now 3/4 done! I can't tell yet whether it is easier or harder to continue with
treatments once you know that the cancer is gone. On the one hand you know it's
working and doing it's job, but on the other it seems pointless. Almost done I
guess....
