My next visit was supposed to be June 5th, but it was delayed because Dr. Blahey
is on vacation. I'm going in on June 12th, next Tuesday, instead. This time I'm
getting a chest x-ray, bloodwork and a physical exam. I guess those PET scans
cause too many false positive scares. I'm very thankful for that because I don't
know if I could handle another one!
