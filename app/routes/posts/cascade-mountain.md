My friend Dave and I had decided long ago to climb Cascade Mountain, and being
the long weekend we set out to do it, cancer or no cancer.

Looking up at Cascade Mountain, from the town of Banff:

The view from the backside, we're going to scramble along the ridge on the
right:

Me heading up the ridge:

Dave stopping for a much needed break:

The scariest part of the scramble, the rock garden:

The last push to the summit:

Looking back down to Banff from near the summit:

We're almost there!

Dave calling Laura from the top:

How's that for a view? (3000m, ~10,000ft)

I'm proud that I did it, but man am I ever sore! I think my experience will help
me knowing I have plenty of strength to make it through the treatment.
