My ultrasound which was supposed to have been done on Saturday has now taken
place on Wednesday. Each day I am told that it might be able to be done the next
day. Finally, that next day is today. I go to the Rocky View Hospital and have
my ultrasound. I strain my neck trying to see the screen as it is happening, but
I can't make out enough of it. Mental note, I need to stretch my neck more. I
ask her how it looks but she explains that she cannot tell me or make an
analysis herself. I guess I will be doing some more waiting.
