Well, yesterday was my 2 year check up. It actually hasn't been two full years
but I guess each of my appointments has been a bit before schedule. I don't
really care though, I'm 2 years cancer free!

Looking back I realize that the memories of my experience are beginning to fade.
I don't think about what I went through as much as I should. I'm taking life for
granted again. I feel like the only thing that I've really taken from this is
compassion for others going through medical issues.

One of my old friends from rowing was recently paralyzed after diving into a
lake, a friend of a friend was diagnosed with Hodkgin's in Victoria and a friend
of a friend was diagnosed with testicular cancer in Calgary. I'd like to
dedicate this milestone to them. You too will soon forget of the trials that
you've been through and life will return to you.

I now only have to go for checkups every 6 months. Pretty slack!
