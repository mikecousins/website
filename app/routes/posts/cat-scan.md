My Dad drove me down to High River this morning for the CAT scan. It was pretty
uneventful, but drinking that marker doesn't taste too good. The IV caused a
strange warm feeling all over my body, pretty weird. I called Dr. Gillis
afterwards and they have to do a surgical biopsy of the lump but they have no
times available for August. I guess it's back to waiting again. I'm getting
tired of waiting.
