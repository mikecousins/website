I think #3 was the worst so far. I've been pretty sick the entire time since
chemo. The second one went well so I was hoping I might get less sick as they
went, but I guess that's not the case.

I'm starting to get over it now though and I'm excited for my trip to Victoria
this weekend. I'm heading out to take pictures at the Head of the Gorge, a big
rowing race. Dawn is coming out with me and I'll get to show her all around my
old home.
