Visited my family doctor's backup today. It sounds like I'll need a referral
from the diagnosing doctor (Dr. Gillis) and that I might need a tissue sample
(surgical biopsy) as well before going to Tom Baker. Dr. Gillis is back next
week so I'll be able to talk to him then, but it sounds like the biopsy might
not be done this month! My dad has to fully pay for our Hawaii trip (Sept 16-Oct
2) next week so I guess he's just going to go ahead and do it. Hopefully chemo
will start when I get back from Hawaii. I just want to know what's going on!
