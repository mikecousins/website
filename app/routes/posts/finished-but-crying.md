I can't remember the last time I was crying, probably last year when my
grandfather passed away, but I am right now. It's been an emotional day.

My chemo went well. The IV slid in on the first try, no burning in my veins, I'm
not feeling all that bad right now, etc.

I got home and checked the Hodgkins support website which I do often. I was all
set to brag about being finished. One of my friends, a beautiful young girl,
diagnosed about the same time as me, sharing the same experiences as me, Caitlin
Homes, had passed away. Her mom posted the message and told us that she got
pneumonia yesterday and passed away in her sleep. My girlfriend welled up at the
news, but I held it together. I didn't want to read too much because I was
having dinner with my girlfriend, my sister and her boyfriend.

We had dinner and then opened up a fantastic bottle of port that my friend
Ananth bought me for finishing chemo. It was delicious! We were all very happy
that I was finally finished with this ordeal.

Then my girlfriend left, my sister and her boyfriend went to sleep, and I went
back to the support website to read it fully. I read the mother's comments and I
read all of the condolences left by the members (all people who have gone
through or who are going through Hodgkins). I completely lost it, and I think I
did so for two reasons.

 1. She was just an amazing girl. She was probably only 20 but she seemed so
    incredibly happy right up until the end. Her comments always included funny
    pictures of her and her friends, she enjoyed life, she made those around her
    happy. She was worried that her sadness would impact her parents so she
    tried to hide it. Why do we lose those who are so good so young?


 2. It made me realize my own mortality. My 30% recurrence chances are not good
    odds. I've made it this far, but am I really done? I sure hope so.



Here are some great pictures of Caitlin, she will always be remembered.

Caitlin is the second person on our board to have passed away after Rickie-Lee
just passed away a little while ago. It's a horrible disease and I hope from the
bottom of my heart that my time with it is over.
