After I was diagnosed I was scared that my PET scan results would come back
showing that I had a large spread of cancer. I got the results back and I had a
large spread. I've been fearing having a low white blood cell count because that
would mean I would have to inject myself with Neupogen daily. Today, the doctor
told me I have a low white blood cell count and here comes the Neupogen! From
now on, I'm going to think happy thoughts and hopefully only good things will
happen.

I guess the first chemo really took my bone marrow out and it's not recovering
too well, so they have to delay chemo #2 until next Wednesday. After that I have
to inject myself with Neupogen on the 5th, 6th and 7th day following each
treatment. Each injection costs $270! Thank you Sun Life!
