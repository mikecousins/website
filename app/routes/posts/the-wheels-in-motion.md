Dr. Gillis is back in the office so I can resume pestering them over the phone!
Due to a cancellation at the hospital they had an opening for surgery on August
29th, so that's when my biopsy is going to take place. It feels good to have a
date scheduled now, even if it is almost 2 weeks away. The receptionist also
gave me the CAT scan results and everything looks good! There seems to be no
spread in my chest or abdomen which is great. About a week after the biopsy I
will have the results and be transferred over to the Tom Baker Centre and a week
after that I'll be going to Hawaii! I don't know what they're going to say about
my vacation, but I'm going to be adamant about going, that's for sure!
