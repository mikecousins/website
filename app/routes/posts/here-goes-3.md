I had my bloodwork done yesterday and chatted with the doctor a bit. My white
blood cells were up to 1.6 this time, still not up into the 2-8 range, so I'm
going to have to do 4 shots each time now of Neupogen. Boo! I told him about my
lung issues and he's going to remove the Bleomycin this time and I have to go
for a lung performance test sometime soon. I hope that goes well.

I'm about to head in for my third chemo and after this one I'll be one quarter
done!
