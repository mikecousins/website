I'm getting most of my staging scheduled now. PET scan this Thursday,
orientation Friday (my family and I can meet everybody at Tom Baker, get a tour,
listen to a talk about cancer, etc.), then the neck biopsy next Monday and bone
marrow Tuesday. I guess after they have the results I'll meet with Dr. Blahey to
figure out chemo/radiation plans.

Dawn came home last night and it's really great to have her back. She got me
some amazing presents from Italy and I'm wearing my new shirt today!

I added some links on the side by popular demand. Some informative links and
some links to other peoples blogs which I have read to give me the lowdown on
what to expect. You might find them informative, give them a read if you want.
