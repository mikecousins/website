Yesterday was pretty uneventful. The radioactive glucose was a little bit late
from Edmonton. I wasn't supposed to have surgery for 2 weeks before the scan,
and this would have been fine, but since they delayed it I had minor surgery the
2 days prior! They said it was okay though because they were both pretty minor,
but I was worried for a bit that they might have to delay it for another 2
weeks!

They got me into a small, dark room with a nice recliner chair. They injected
the glucose through an IV and I sat still in my chair for about an hour. I just
had an hour long nap! Then the scan took about an hour and I went home.

I get my stitches out of my neck next Thursday and then I have my appointment
the next Tuesday. I feel free not having too many doctor's appointments coming
up! I leave tomorrow morning for the Okanagan with Dawn and I'm very excited
about the trip. It will be so nice to get away and relax for a while.
