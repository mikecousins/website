Well, it's been 3 months already. I went for my first post treatment check-up
and it went pretty well. I asked about diving again and Dr. Blahey said that it
would be best if I never dove again. I guess it's time to start forgetting about
it. My veins should start to get better after about 6 months. The main vein in
my bicep used to be big and soft and it has now turned into a little, hard,
brown wire running up my arm. I hope it starts to soften up soon. My white blood
cells aren't returning very quickly. They have only climbed to 1.6 from 1.4
before my last treatment. For comparison, the normal range is 2-8 and I was at
11 before chemo (elevated because of the cancer).

I've got a PET scan and another check-up in about 3 months. Until then I'm going
to keep on trucking and getting back into shape. My energy levels seem to be
pretty much back to normal, though I feel like I haven't slept enough most of
the time. I've been playing beach volleyball at lunch, I'm in two evening indoor
volleyball leagues (Mon & Wed), and I've started biking with Dawn again. Bring
on summer!
