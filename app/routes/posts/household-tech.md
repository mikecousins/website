So this is happening, the Cousins family is building their house!

As many of you know, this house is going to be pretty full of technology. I
thought as I'm planning everything I would start a series of posts on the
awesome things I'm doing tech wise. I get many questions about how to accomplish
various tasks, so hopefully this will help you. Some of the highlights are going
to include:

 * Using Plex to setup your own video "cloud" like Netflix.
   (https://www.mikecousins.com/plex-and-the-streaming-life/)
 * Home theater design and building.
 * Home networking with multiple wifi access points for great coverage indoors
   and outdoors. (https://www.mikecousins.com/enterprise-quality-wifi-at-home/)
 * Home automation. Get your doorknobs talking to your lightbulbs.
 * Using a file server to improve reliability and portability.
 * Backing up your data. You must do this.
 * Setting up a VOIP system for cheap phone calls.
 * Tips for building a new house.

Strap in and come along for the ride!
