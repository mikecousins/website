Well, my first application has been published.

http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=e995f3ee-9fd4-4e60-bdba-a30168099cd1

My first attempt was a bit of a probe to see what the process is like. I whipped
the app together in about an hour and it was quite basic. I wanted to see:

 * If I would be rejected
 * What I would be rejected for
 * What the timelines are like

Turns out I was rejected in about 2 or 3 days for two reasons.  I had no error
handling in my data requests so it would crash in airplane mode and I had no
progress bars while I was retrieving data from the server!  I put those in last
Thursday and submitted it again and today I received my approval.  Pretty cool
stuff!My one concern so far is that the time from when I was told that my app
was published until it came online was a bit long and there was no feedback on
this process.  It took about 8 hours or so, but it's up there now in all of it's
glory.

Now to make the photographer app and then move on to Android and iOS.  Halfway
to my free phone from the Mango App Challenge
