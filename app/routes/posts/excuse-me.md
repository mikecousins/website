I have always believed that I caught this early, and I've always feared that I
hadn't. It looks like my fears have won. I got the PET scan results today and
not only is the cancer on both sides of my lymph node system it's also spread to
my liver. So instead of being Stage 1 (the best) as they originally thought I am
now Stage 4 (the worst). I will now have to have at least 6 months of
chemotherapy and survival rates drop a bit. I have to go for an MRI of my liver
soon as well. Ever since my diagnosis I've never really feared for my survival,
I was mostly just worried about possible side effects of the treatment. I think
that has now changed.
