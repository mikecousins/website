Days 5-8 of each cycle are days that I get my Neupogen injections. They
stimulate your bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. This causes the
bone marrow to expand and on day 9, today, it is at it's peak. It hurts the most
in my hips because that is where you have the most bone marrow. I brought my
bottle of Tylenol into work today and it's sitting beside me.

I guess it's kind of fitting that it's happening on Rememberance Day this time.
I hope you all take the time to remember those who fought for us so long ago. We
live in the best country in the world, and I'm sure without them it would be
quite different today.
