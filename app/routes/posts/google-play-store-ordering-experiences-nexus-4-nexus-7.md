**Nexus 7**

Here is the timeline of my Nexus 7 order.

*June 27, 2012*

I watched the Google event for the launch of the Nexus 7 and ordered it
immediately after as soon as sales were opened.

*June 27, 2012*

Minutes after ordering I realize that my address was my old address so I submit
an address change request on my order.

*July 4, 2012*

No updates to the address on my order so I submit a second address change
request.

*July 11, 2012*

Still no updates to the address on my order so I submit a third address change
request.

*July 16, 2012*

Nexus 7 is available in stores. Yes, before they've shipped to pre-ordering
customers.

*July 19, 2012*

Nexus 7 is shipped to the incorrect address. Customer service tells me they
can't do anything to help me other than let it go back to them and then order
another one. It is currently out of stock and not available for several weeks. I
end up calling again and get a more helpful agent who changes my address to the
correct one.

*October 5, 2012*

I get a response to my three address change requests asking if they're still
valid. Thanks Google...

**Nexus 4**

There is no time given for when we can begin ordering the Nexus 4, only a date,
November 13, 2012. The first rumour is 12am PST so I stay up until 1am MST and
they don't go up for sale. I check for the next rumoured time and it's 9am PST
so I go to sleep.

25 minutes or so before 9am PST they go up for sale. The site is a crashing mess
and I try to order a 16GB for several minutes. None of my attempts are
successful and it soon says that it's sold out. I switch to the 8GB which is
still available. After several minutes of trying I finally get a successful
order through. I'm not that happy because I really wanted a 16GB model.

I check my Google Wallet account and it shows an order for a 16GB version.
That's strange. 5 minutes later an order for an 8GB version appears as well. A
while later I also get emails confirming those two orders. Bonus! Lots of my
friends offer to take the 8GB off of my hands and I'm happy.

Now, two days after, on the day my order is supposed to ship, I just received an
email stating that my order is back ordered and won't ship for another 3 weeks.

This is pretty ridiculous Google. I've never had a worse retail experience and
I've now had it twice.
