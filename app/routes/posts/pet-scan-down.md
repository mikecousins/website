The PET scanner is down today so they rescheduled me for next Wednesday. I guess
I can eat breakfast now. It sucks because now I'm missing a going away lunch for
a coworker.

We had our first Nortel Corporate Challenge volleyball practice last night and
I'm pretty excited for it. It went really well and it's great to be playing
indoor again. Our team is pretty strong, but I hope I can make it. I also hope
that if I make the team I don't have to miss it because of treatments. One more
practice and then they make cuts.
