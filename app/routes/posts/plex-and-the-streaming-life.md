Lately people have been discovering how much better the on demand streaming
model of Netflix is than normal cable television. The biggest downside though is
the limited selection. The solution is to run your own media streaming service,
and the best way to do that is by using Plex.

Server

The first step is to get a Plex server running. It runs on many different NAS
services as well as on regular Windows/Mac/Linux computers. I used to run it on
a Synology NAS but, after running out of space one too many times, have since
migrated to a full-blown Windows server.

My server consists of the following parts:

 * Norco RPC-4224
 * Intel Core i7-4770k
 * ASUS Z87-A
 * 16GB Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR3
 * A whole bunch of WD Red hard drives

Clients

In the living room we are using a Vizio TV which I chose because it has a decent
Plex app that runs on it.

In the bonus room we are running a full HTPC which runs the Plex app as well as
video games.

On our mobile devices we use the iOS and Android Plex apps.

The Experience

The beauty of Plex reveals itself when you fully embrace it. The fact that your
watched status is stored on the server and every device gives you the same
window into your media is life changing. What episode are we on for Stranger
Things? Plex knows. Want to finish the show that you're currently watching in
the living room on your tablet in bed after washing up? Plex will resume it from
where you were. Have a family? Plex will remember each person's watch status.
