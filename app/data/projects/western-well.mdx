My first client in a new program run by Startup Lloydminster/Alberta Innovates. I ran a 3 month
engagement with the goal of helping them improve their technology posture. The first month was
spent doing a deep dive into how their business currently operates, how they use technology,
any pain points they currently have, etc.

After learning that they had some efficiency issues generating reports for their clients I brought
together some experts in their technology stack (Google AppSheet). Together we made a couple
improvements which should shave ~15 minutes off of the admin work on each client report. I also
generated a calculator that they can use for calculating the financial payback time for future
technical projects. They are planning some larger moves in the future and I helped them with
advice for how to accomplish this.
