Hired as the first employee at a telehealth company focused on remote indigenous communities. After many pivots
we launched an anti-HIV brand called Freddie, followed by an ADHD brand called Frida and a gender affirming care
brand named Foria. We have grown to a $65m+ ARR business employing 200+ employees across Canada and the United
States.

I have worn a wide variety of hats, helping in many areas of the company. I managed the engineering department
and grew the team to ~20 employees. I wrote the entire front-end of the first few iterations of our product in
React/Typescript. I managed our technology usage across the entire company, overseeing privacy, compliance and
IT. I was responsible for overall system architecture.
