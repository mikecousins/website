Originally hired to develop a Windows desktop application for a white-labelled product for Dentrix/Henry Schein
called Dentrix Secure-Mail. After a successful launch of that product I moved into our web application and
successfully rewrote a Java/GWT app into React/Typescript. I was the front-end lead and responsible for all
architecture and leading a small team of developers and designers.
