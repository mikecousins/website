I have now finished number 6! They are definitely getting worse. I get this
horrible taste in my mouth during the treatment and it hasn't really gone away.
The nausea has been about average this time, but I'm getting very tired.
Thursday I got up at 1:30pm and was back in bed by about 4pm. That would be an
ideal day for me if I didn't have to do anything else!

I have one more treatment this year and then it's Christmas and Dave/Laura's
wedding time!
