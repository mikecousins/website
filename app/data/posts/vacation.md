No, not mine, every doctor in the city of Calgary! I need to get a referral to
get into the Tom Baker Center (Calgary's cancer center) and both Dr. Gillis and
my family doctor are on vacation. Dr. Gillis's backup doctor is also on vacation
so the whole office is closed next week. I have an appointment on Monday with my
family doctor's backup who will hopefully give me a referral so that I can get
into Tom Baker next week. I have so many questions for them, and I just want to
get my treatment underway. Waiting is doing nothing for my nerves.
