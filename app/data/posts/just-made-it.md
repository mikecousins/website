Our white blood cell counts are supposed to be between 2 and 8. Last week's test
put me at 0.4. My doctor said he won't do chemo if it's under 1. This week I
rocked it and got 1.1! This afternoon is chemo #2 and I'm not really looking
forward to it. I felt kind of sick this morning, I guess I'm just getting
excited for the nausea!
