I was in the Okanagan with Dawn for the long weekend, visiting my Grandma,
touring some wineries and getting some time on the beach. We stayed at a nice
bed & breakfast in Peachland. It was all great except that we were going to hit
the beach on Sunday but it was cool and rained a bit so we didn't end up going.
We had some excitement the first night when we almost walked right into a black
bear on a dirt path by the golf course and on our brisk walk home we walked
right past another one in the bushes (maybe 2-3 feet away!). I saw it first and
didn't tell Dawn because I thought she would run! Sunday night a coyote got into
our bed & breakfast and their dog fought it in the kitchen and pushed it out of
the house! Excitement aside, it was a great trip and it was nice to have a
little bit of a vacation.
