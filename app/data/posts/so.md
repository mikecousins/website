I think this blog is pretty much done. I'll keep you updated with scan results
but hopefully I won't have to use this much again.

My next scan is May 30th, just bloodwork and a physical exam. I will have a PET
scan near the end of the year.

I'm feeling pretty much back to normal. All of the side effects except tiredness
are gone. My hair is even starting to come back!
