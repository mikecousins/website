Phase 1 (beat cancer) - check

Phase 2 (get back in shape) - starting now

I'm back at work now and trying to get my sleep schedule back to something
manageable. I'm hoping to start working out next week, we'll see how that goes.
I signed up for 2 volleyball leagues for the summer and I'm thinking about maybe
doing something else. It's exciting because I can do whatever I want this
summer! Not that I couldn't before, but this summer just feels different....
