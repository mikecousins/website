When I talked to the Tom Baker Cancer Centre yesterday they were pretty
surprised at how long it was taking me to get stuff going with my other doctor.
They just called and told me that I'm supposed to come in tomorrow. It'll just
be an informative session and they'll book me for orientation, the biopsy,
chemo, etc. I'm glad things are moving along quicker now. It's nice to know that
I'm at Tom Baker finally too. Things are looking up!
