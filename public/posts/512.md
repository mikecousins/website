Number 5 is now past me. It was a pretty bad start, I normally don't have any
trouble getting the IV in and this time took 5 tries between 3 nurses. I'm so
tracked up I look like a junkie. I normally don't start feeling sick until later
that night or the next morning and this time I felt sick from the second it
started flowing too. Today has been par for the course though, not too bad. The
weather is getting nice here so hopefully I'll get outside for a bit soon. I
need to enjoy the last couple good days before winter sets in!
